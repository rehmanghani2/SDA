# Protected Variability
Protected Variability is a design principle in GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) that aims to encapsulate and protect areas of variability in a software system.


# Purpose: 
The primary purpose of Protected Variability is to:


1. Isolate changes: Minimize the impact of changes on other parts of the system.
2. Improve maintainability: Make it easier to modify or extend the system.
3. Reduce coupling: Decrease dependencies between classes.

# Key Elements:


1. Variation Point: Identify areas of variability in the system.
2. Protection Mechanism: Introduce a protection mechanism (e.g., interface, abstract class) to encapsulate variability.


# Benefits:


1. Improved maintainability: Changes are localized, reducing the risk of ripple effects.
2. Increased flexibility: New variations can be added without modifying existing code.
3. Reduced coupling: Classes are decoupled, making it easier to modify or replace individual components.
